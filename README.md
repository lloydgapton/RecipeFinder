Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a web application designed to help users easily search for and save their favorite recipes. This project was developed as a solo effort to showcase my skills in React.js, Tailwind CSS, and API integration.

Features

- **Search Recipes**: Users can search for recipes by entering a keyword, which retrieves a list of related recipes.
- **View Ingredients**: Click on any recipe to view a detailed list of ingredients.
- **Save Favorites**: Users can save their favorite recipes for easy access later.

Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **API Integration**: [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) - Provides access to a vast collection of recipes.
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - A platform for frontend developers, providing seamless integration and deployment.

Project Architecture

- **React.js**: Used to build the dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the application with a focus on rapid prototyping and responsiveness.
- **Forkify API**: Integrated to fetch and display a wide range of recipes based on user search queries.
- **Vercel**: Chosen for deploying the application, enabling continuous integration and easy management of environment variables.

## Development Process

Successes
- Successfully integrated the Forkify API to provide a broad selection of recipes with minimal latency.
- Developed a user-friendly interface that received positive feedback for its simplicity and ease of use.
- Deployed the application on Vercel, ensuring quick and smooth updates.

Challenges
- Managing global state across different components and handling API errors effectively.
- Ensuring the application remained responsive and user-friendly even under varying conditions.

Areas for Improvement
- Adding advanced filtering options in the search functionality, such as filtering by dietary preferences or cooking time.
- Optimizing performance, especially in handling large datasets from the API.

Lessons Learned
- The importance of effective state management in React applications.
- Utilizing React Context and custom hooks to manage state more efficiently.
- The value of thorough testing, particularly in handling edge cases, to ensure stability and reliability.

Next Steps

- Implementing user authentication to allow users to save their favorite recipes across devices.
- Expanding the project to include user-generated content, such as recipe submissions.
